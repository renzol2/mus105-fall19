# The Mark class inherits from IntEnum to enumerate various types
# of notation marks that appear in musical scores. Each Mark enum is
# a 16 bit value with the format 'ggggggggrrrrrrrr', where:
# @code
# 7654321076543210
# gggggggg--------   the 'group' of the mark (dynamic, articulation, etc.)
# --------rrrrrrrr   the 'rank' of the identifier within its group.
# @endcode
#
# The mark module defines four top-level 'group' constants: DYNAMIC,
# ARTICULATION, ORNAMENT, and TEMPORAL. These constants are assigned
# the values 0 to 3 and left-shifted 8 bits.

# The DYNAMIC group enums are: NIENTE, PPPP, PPP, PP, P, MP, MF, F, FF, FFF,
# FFFF, SFZ, CRESCENDO, CRESCENDO_END, DECRESCENDO, DECRESCENDO_END.
# These enums all have DYNAMIC as their upper byte and their lower byte
# holds their rank value 0-15.

# The ARTICULATION group enums are: TENUTO, DETATCHED, STACCATO, STACCATISSIMO,
# ACCENT, MARCATO. These enums all have ARTICULATION as their upper byte and
# their lower byte holds their rank value 0-5.

# The ORNAMENT group enums are: TRILL, MORDENT, TURN. These enums all have
# ORNAMENT as their upper byte and their lower byte holds their rank value 0-2.

# The TEMPORAL group enums are: FERMATA, ACCEL, DEACCEL. These enums all have
# TEMPORAL as their upper byte and their lower byte holds their rank value 0-2.
