# PHRYGIAN, LYDIAN, MIXOLYDIAN, AEOLIAN, and LOCRIAN. The value for each mode
# should be a number index 0-6 representing its diatonic scale degree C-B.
# For example, MAJOR will be 0 (C), MINOR is 5 (A) and Dorian is 1 (D).
# Define IONIAN and AEOLIAN as synonyms for MAJOR and MINOR by assigning
# them their corresponding enum value.
