#  A class that implements fractional numbers.
#  The Ratio class provides exact arithmetic for representing exact musical
#  quantities such as proportional (metric) time, duration, and 'just' tuning
#  intervals. Ratios can be created from two integers or from a string.
#  Ratios are compared and combined using the standard math operators.

class Ratio:
    num = 0
    den = 0

    # Creates a Ratio from integers, a floating point number, or a string name.
    #  * Ratio(int, int) - creates a ratio from an integer numerator and denominator.
    #  * Ratio(int) - creates a ratio from an integer numerator with the denominator
    #  set to 1.
    #  * Ratio(float) - creates a ratio from a floating point number
    #  (see: as_integer_ratio())
    #  * Ratio(string) -  creates a ratio from a string 'num/den'. Both num and
    #  den must produce valid integers.
    #
    #  @param num If only num is specified it must be either an integer, float,
    #  or a string containing a valid ratio expression 'a/b'. If both num and
    #  den are provided they must both be integer value.
    #  @param den If specified den must be a non-zero integer denominator
    #
    #  Upon construction the new ratio will always be expressed in its most simple
    #  form, for example Ratio(6,12) will become Ratio(1/2), See: gcd().
    #  If both the numerator and denominator are negative the ratio should be
    #  converted to positive by the constructor.
    #
    #  The constructor should raise a TypeError if the num or den is not a integer,
    #  string or float and a DivisionByZero error if the denominator is 0.
