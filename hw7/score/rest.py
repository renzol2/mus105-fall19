# an exact beat duration.
class Rest (Durational):

    ## Initializes a Rest and its two attributes self.dur and self.voice.
    # @param dur The Ratio duration of the Rest. The initializer
    # should call the Durational superclass' __init__() function
    # to set the dur attribute.

    #  <Rest: 1/4 0x10999e390>
