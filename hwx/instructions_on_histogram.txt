INSTRUCTIONS ON READING HISTOGRAMS


[ Source of Statistics: C-Score ]
	All statistics (i.e. probabilities in the histograms) were collected from a corpus of
	Bach's 4-part (SATB) chorales TRANSPOSED to the C-Score, or more precisely,
	TRANSPOSED to a score whose key signature contains no accidentals (0 sharps, 0 flats).


[ Form of the histograms ]
	Every histogram displays, row by row,
	the top K most probable feature values (labels) and their corresponding probabilities.
	More specifically,
	* K = min( 50, total # of feature values with non-zero probabilities );
	* probabilities are rounded to 2 decimal places.

	As a result, every observed 0.00 is not exactly 0, but a positive value that is close to 0.
	Furthermore,
	* when K < 50, every unseen feature value has a probability 0 (exact);
	* when K = 50, every unseen feature value has either a probability 0 (exact) or a probability
	  that is even smaller than the 50th smallest probability shown in the histogram.

	Yet in any event, one should not bother too much about the actual value of a probability;
	comparing the probabilities relatively is good enough.
