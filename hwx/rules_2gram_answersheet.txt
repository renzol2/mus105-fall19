[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=66, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=66, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the probabilities of starting notes (pitch class) in the soprano voice.
2.  Generally, the first chord in a chorale will be the I chord, and the histogram supports this trend with the tonic,
    third, and fifth of the I chord being the most prominent notes in the soprano voice on the starting chord.
3.  The above "trend" is not a hard and fast rule, as the submediant is also a prominent note in the soprano voice
    on the starting chord (20%). This may be due to a chorale that starts on the vi chord - the relative minor, which shares
    a similar tonic function with the I chord.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=66, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=66, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the probabilities of notes (pitch classes) in the soprano voice with the previous note being
    the tonic.
2.  According to the histogram, the most prominent pitches are the leading tone and the supertonic. Since individual
    parts within the chorale tend to be stepwise for the majority of the piece, it makes sense that the two most
    prominent pitches that follow the tonic are one step below and one step above it. Additionally, the histogram also
    highlights that the tonic is often used as the final note in the soprano voice.
3.  The next most probable pitch following the tonic after the leading tone and supertonic is the fifth/dominant tone,
    which is not stepwise and is actually quite far (fourth/fifth away). However, this is likely due to the dominant
    tone being part of the I chord, as well as being part of the dominant chord that could follow a tonic or predominant
    IV chord that the soprano is a part of.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=66, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=66, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the probabilities of notes (pitch classes) in the soprano voice with the previous note being
    the subdominant (fourth).
2.  Like before, the two most prominent pitches are naturally the two notes one step away (in this case, they are the
    mediant and the dominant tones). However, the subdominant is much more likely to resolve downwards to the mediant
    than up towards the dominant tone (64% vs. 28%). This is because the subdominant tone is a half step away from the
    mediant in the major scale, while the subdominant and dominant tones are a whole step away. This behavior is likely
    due to an authentic cadence of V7 -> I, with the seventh of the V7 chord resolving to the third of the I chord.
3.  The non-stepwise tones that tend to follow the subdominant tone are the supertonic and the submediant. These are a
    third away from the subdominant tone (so not too far), and they also help highlight a ii or IV chord.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=66, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=66, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the probabilities of pitch classes in the soprano voice, with the previous note being the
    dominant (fifth).
2.  As before, the two most prominent pitches are stepwise (subdominant/submediant), which again is important in the
    context of writing primarily stepwise melodies. For non-stepwise motion, the fifth tends to move to the tonic
    (likely part of an authentic cadence) or the emdiant (possibly to highlight the I chord or as a small downwards leap).
3.  There are no hard or fast rules for what comes after the fifth. Interestingly, however, the fifth sometimes goes
    a half step downward (possibly for a secondary dominant, like the V/V) but almost never goes a half step upward.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=66, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=66, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  Same feature as before, but this time looking at notes after the leading tone.
2.  Unsurprisingly, the leading tone almost always goes up to the tonic (due to the half step difference) or down to
    the submediant (stepwise motion going down the scale).
3.  For non-stepwise motion, the leading tone sometimes goes to the mediant or the fifth, though this is rare because
    the leading tone must almost always be resolved to the tonic or at least be used in stepwise motion.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the simple interval between the soprano and bass voices on the starting chord.
2.  The two most prominent intervals are the unison/octave (likely doubling the tonic in a I chord) or a fifth (again
    forming a tonic chord). This makes sense as most of the chorales would generally start on the I chord. The major third
    is also seen at 9%, although much less prominent than the others.
3.  The minor third is also seen at a rarer but still notable 3%, which could possibly be the starting chord being in
    the relative or parallel minor.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the simple interval between the soprano and bass voices on chords after the soprano and bass
    have a unison/octave.
2.  The four most prominent intervals that follow a unison/octave are: fifth, minor third, major third, minor sixth.
    Interestingly, it is very rare for the soprano and bass to repeat a unison/octave (3%), though this makes sense
    as both these voices are so harmonically important that they must move to change the harmony. Also interesting is
    that this appearance of a unison acts as an ending, which makes sense as most of Bach's chorales end in a PAC
    with the root doubled in the soprano and bass.
3.  No hard or fast rules are broken here, though it is interesting that the leap from a unison/octave to a tritone
    interval has been used at least once within Bach's chorales (seen as a dissonant and inadvisable interval).

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the simple interval between the soprano and bass on chords after they have a minor third.
2.  Unlike last time where repeating the same interval twice is very rare, minor thirds tend to follow minor thirds between
    the soprano and bass voices. This may be due to the inner voices changing the harmony rather than the soprano/bass,
    which is an example of oblique motion. The change from a third to a fifth is equally as prominent.
3.  No hard or fast rules are broken here, though it is interesting to note that this histogram is less polarizing than
    the previous one involving intervals after a unison/octave.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature considers the simple interval between soprano and bass following a tritone.
2.  The most prominent interval after the tritone is the major third, which actually makes perfect sense. It is likely
    that this interval is seen in IACs with the V7 chord being in first inversion. Therefore, the B in the bass would
    resolve to a C, and the F in the soprano would resolve down to the E, which would be a tritone -> M3. The next
    most prominent interval is the minor third, likely due to an IAC in a minor tonality.
3.  Interestingly, the next most prominent interval is the minor sixth, but I don't know in what context this pattern
    of intervals would be used for.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  Same as before, but this feature considers intervals following a fifth.
2.  The most prominent interval following a fifth is the unison/octave, likely due to some sort of cadence or other form
    of resolution.
3.  This histogram is much less polarizing than the previous, meaning that no hard or fast rules are seen with intervals
    between soprano and voice following a fifth.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=157, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature shows the probability of chords (collection of pitch classes) at the start of a pitch.
2.  The most prominent chord at the start of a chorale is (unsurprisingly) the I chord, followed by the vi chord. These
    chords serve tonic functions harmonically, and thus it makes sense that they are used at the start. Additionally,
    the root of those chords are doubled, likely in the soprano and bass. Interestingly, the ii chord is also used
    at a 9% probability, which serves predominant function and is likely used to set up a cadence in the following chords.
3.  One chord that is used 2% of the time is 1,4,9,9, which is likely the V/ii chord and one chord I did not expect to be
    even marginally prominent at the start.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=157, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  This feature shows the probability of chords following a I chord with the root doubled.
2.  This histogram is extremely spread out, showing that within Bach's chorales, there is no clear cut answer for
    what exact chord to follow a I chord. Some prominent options include repeating the I chord, V chord, IV chord,
    V7/IV chord, etc. It is also notable that the I chord is often used to end the piece, as shown in the histogram.
3.  Some chords, however, do not make sense to me. For example, the most prominent chord example is 0,4,7,11, which
    translates to C E G B. Within the harmony of Bach's chorales, this doesn't make too much sense, though it could be
    part of a suspension or other occurrence that is dependent on its context more heavily. Another strange chord shown
    is 0,2,5,7 -> C D F G, which may also be a weird inversion or suspension.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=157, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.

1.  Shows the probability of chords following a V chord with root doubled.
2.  As opposed to the previous histogram, this histogram shows that there are two main chords that follow a V chord:
    a V7 chord and a I chord. This makes perfect sense according to Western music theory, as it sets up an authentic
    cadence that eventually resolves.
3.  The other chords make less sense than the two obvious ones, though they are much rarer - these include:
    0,4,7,9 -> C E G A (maybe part of a modulation section?)
    0,2,7,9 -> C D G A (not sure what chord this is, maybe part of a suspension)

1.  Same as before, but now looking at chords after V7.
2.  The histogram clearly shows that V7 chords generally resolve to the I chord in various voicings.
3.  There are more unexpected chords than I anticipated, including:
    2,4,7,11 -> D E G B (maybe an anticipation towards a I chord)
    4,4,8,11 -> E G# B (perhaps used as a modulation to the relative minor, since it's the V/vi)
    0,4,9,11 -> C E A B (maybe part of an anticipation but not sure...)

1.  Same as before, but now looking at the chord D E G# B, likely V7/vi.
2.  Like before, this V7 generally resolves to some voicing of its I, in this case the vi chord. However, it is also
    seen to resolve to the V7/VI, with the VI chord also being the V/ii. This chord is likely part of a cycle around
    the circle of fifths that eventually resolves to the home key.
3.  Some less obvious observations:
    0,5,9,9 -> C F A (The IV chord, which is diatonic and could resolve back to I)
    0,4,9,11 -> C E A B (perhaps the B is part of a suspension?)
