1.  Here, the order of the voices is considered, i.e. each from voice from highest down to lowest.
2.  Yes, this histogram generally agrees to the rule that none of the voices should cross each other. This rule
    states that the order of voices should always be soprano > alto > tenor > bass. The histogram agrees with the rule
    90% of the time, while another 7% of cases have either the soprano note equal to the alto note, the alto note equal
    to the tenor note, or the tenor note equal to the bass note.
3.  The histogram only disagrees with this rule about 2% of the time, where either the tenor note is shown to cross the
    alto note or the alto note crosses the soprano note.

1.  This feature considers the probability of each pitch class in the soprano voice.
2.  According to the histogram, there are five prominent pitches that appear in the soprano voice:(starting from most
    prominent) the third, the tonic, the supertonic, the sixth, and the fifth. Interestingly, these form the major
    pentatonic scale, but more importantly they are essential pitches to forming melodies. The third and tonic highlight
    the tonic major triad, while the supertonic and sixth are likely used as passing tones that also form dominant or
    pre-dominant chords with the other voices. Also notable is the leading tone appearing about 9% of the time
    according to the histogram, which is about half the probability of the tonic. This makes sense as the leading tone
    is almost exclusively used in cadences, primarily authentic cadences to end a phrase or piece. The last major pitch
    seen in the soprano voice is the fourth, which again is primarily used in IACs or as a passing tone between the
    third and the fifth. The main rule that coincides with these pitches is that they all belong within the diatonic
    major scale.
3.  This histogram does not disagree with any hard or fast rules. The pitches rarely seen in the soprano voice are the
    tritone, sharp fifth/flat sixth, sharp unison/flat second, augmented sixth/minor seventh, and augmented second/minor
    third. These pitches do not belong in the diatonic major scale, and any rare appearance is likely due to the
    occasional secondary dominant or instance of modal mixture.

1.  This feature considers the probability of each pitch class in the alto voice.
2.  Like the soprano voice, most of the prominent pitches belong to the diatonic major scale, the least prominent of
    these being the fourth at a 6% probability. However, the alto voices differs from the soprano in that its most
    prominent pitch is the fifth, rather than the soprano being the third. This makes sense as the soprano and alto
    voices would tend to use different pitches to form chords.
3.  Some of the non-diatonic pitches are more prominent in the alto than in the soprano voice, albeit only slightly.

2.  As before, all the prominent pitches are within the diatonic major scale. Like the alto voice, the most prominent
    pitch is the fifth, which differs from the soprano voice being the third.
3.  The tenor voice is similar to the alto voice in that non-diatonic pitches are seen slightly more than in
    the soprano voice, but again not by much.

1.  This feature considers the probablity of each pitch class in the bass voice.
2.  Like before, all the prominent pitches of the bass voice are diatonic. However, the most prominent pitch in the
    bass voice is the tonic, which makes sense as every PAC must end with the tonic in the bass. The bass voice in
    general carries much of the 'tonicity' of a chord, which explains why the tonic is used so much.
3.  Interestingly, the bass note has every pitch class (even non-diatonic) appear at least 1% of the time, including
    the minor third/augmented second which sees almost no representation in any of the other voices.

1.  This feature considers the distance from the soprano voice to the bass voice in semitones, i.e. the interval between
    both parts.
2.  The two most prominent intervals between the soprano and bass voices are the compound fifth and a unison with two
    octaves in between. The fifth and unison/octave are extremely important in Western music and thus it makes sense
    that these two intervals are seen the most between the two parts that form much of the backbone of a four-part
    Bach chorale. Other prominent intervals include a compound major and minor third, which make sense as the soprano
    voice's most prominent pitch is the third while the root's most prominent pitch is the tonic.
3.  One rule that "may" be broken is the presence of a compound tritone at 3% probability, but this may be due to
    a dominant chord in third inversion (with the seventh in the bass and the third in the soprano).

1.  This feature considers the simple intervals between the soprano and bass voice (similar to the previous feature
    but only for simple intervals due to the mod_12 descriptor).
2.  This histogram is very similar to the previous one: the two most prominent intervals are the unison (octave) and
    the fifth, with the second two most prominent being the major and minor third. More noticeably here are the
    third two most prominent intervals: the major and minor sixth. The minor sixth is likely due to major chords in
    first inversion, with the third in the bass and the root in the soprano.
3.  Like before, the tritone is at 3%, most likely due to dominant chords. The minor seventh is also present at 3%,
    which could also be due to dominant chords (root in bass, seventh in soprano).

1.  This feature considers the intervals between the alto and tenor voices.
2.  The distance between the inner voices generally must not exceed an octave and preferably should be even lower, such
    as around a sixth or so. The histogram shows that this rule is abided by for the vast majority of Bach's chorales,
    with 92% of intervals being less than octave.
3.  However, there are some exceptions. An octave between the alto and tenor voices appear about 2% of the time. More
    interestingly is the presence of crossing, where the tenor voice goes higher than the alto voice. While exceedingly
    rare (< 1% probability), it still exists within Bach's chorales. Additionally, there are also intervals that exceed
    an octave (again at < 1% probability), with the largest being a two octave gap.

1.  This feature considers the simple intervals between the alto and tenor voices.
2.  When consolidating all intervals to simple, it is clearer to see that the fourth is the most prominent interval
    between the alto and tenor voices. This is likely due to inversions, where tertiary chords use fourths when going
    from the fifth ascending to the root. The minor third is also widely prominent, which makes sense as a major
    chord in root position would have the third and fifth of the chord placed in the tenor and alto voices, respectively,
    forming a minor third interval (ex. S A T B --> notes: C [P4] G [m3] E [M3] C).
3.  The tritone is a generally dissonant interval that appears a decent amount (6% probability), but it is most likely
    due to the presence of diminished or dominant chords and generally makes sense within the inner voices to provide
    tension that is resolved upon the completion of a cadence.

1.  This feature considers the combination of intervals between all four parts: S/A, A/T, T/B.
2.  The most prominent set of intervals at 6% probability is a fourth, minor third, and compound major third. This
    forms a major chord in root position, with the tonic doubled between the soprano and bass. This makes sense within
    the context of Bach's chorales, as this is the chord that completes a PAC. The second most prominent set of intervals
    at 5% probability is a minor third, major third, and octave. This forms another major chord in root position, but
    the root is instead doubled between the bass and tenor voice. This type of chord likely resolves an IAC, another
    common cadence within Bach's chorales. At 4% probability, the set of intervals is a major third, fourth, and fifth,
    again forming another major chord but with the root doubled between the root and alto. There is obviously a pattern
    with major chords being by far the most common chord in Bach's chorales, which makes sense considering the major
    tonality of most of Bach's chorales. The first non-major chord shown is a minor chord in root position at 3% probability,
    with the root doubled between the bass and alto.
3.  Many of the interval sets found at the bottom (< 1% probability) are inversions of more uncommon chords like minor
    and diminished chords, but there are some combinations that don't quite add up to a particular chord quality.
    Ex: M2, fifth, fifth (SATB -> E D G C) (could be a Maj9 chord but that's not quite Bach)
        m2, fifth, fifth (SATB -> Eb D G C) (again, min9 chord but not quite Bach either)
        fourth, M6, fifth (SATB -> A E G C) (min7 first inversion? seventh chords that aren't dominant or diminished are rare though)

2.  As before, this histogram highlights the prominence of major chords and their different voicings present within
    Bach's chorales, which makes sense due to the diatonic nature of these pieces.
3.  Examples from the < 1% probability sets that don't quite add up:
        fourth, fifth, m3 (SATB -> Eb Bb Eb C) (min7 chord with fifth removed?)
        fifth, fifth, fourth (SATB -> G C F C) (sus4 chord? but not really)

1.  This feature considers the pitch class of each voice and sorts them, effectively giving a set of ordered pitch classes
    that not only give intervals but also the root note of each chord.
2.  Chords starting from most prominent (these aren't all chords, also I didn't take into account repeated patterns
        like 0,0,4,7 vs. 0,4,4,7):
    0,0,4,7 -> C E G; I chord (12%)
    2,7,11 -> D G B; V chord (8%)
    0,4,9 -> C E A; vi chord (6%)
    4,8,11 -> E G# B; III chord (4%) !!
    2,5,9 -> D F A; ii chord (3%)
    1,4,9 -> C# E A; VI chord (3%) !!
    2,5,7,11 -> D F G B; V7 chord (3%)
    0,5,9 -> C F A; IV chord (3%)
    2,6,9 -> D F# A; II chord (2%) !!
    etc.

    (!! denotes non-diatonic)

    As shown, the vast majority of chords shown are diatonic, with the most prominent being the I chord (no surprise).
    Since Bach chorales generally start and end on the I chord, as well as land on the I chord multiple times in
    the piece, it makes perfect sense that it is the most prominent chord. It is also no surprise that the V chord is
    the second most prominent, as the V chord has dominant function that leads back to the I chord.
3.  However, I expected for the IV and ii chord to be more prominent, due to their pre-dominant function. Therefore,
    struck me as a surprise to find the vi and (especially) the III chords to be more prominent. However, it can make
    sense as the III chord is used as a secondary dominant: the V/vi chord. And since the vi chord is the tonic of the
    relative minor, it is no surprise that those two chords are prominent within Bach's chorales - still, I expected the
    ii and IV chords to be more prominent. I also expected the V7 chord to be shown more, but it pales in comparison to
    the V chord (3% vs. 8% probability).

    (related to point 2) All of the non-diatonic chords are secondary dominants to other, usually diatonic, chords.
    The III chord is actually the V/vi chord, the VI chord is the V/ii, and the II is the V/V. This shows Bach's
    tendency to use secondary dominants throughout his chorales, taking advantage of their powerful harmonic qualities.
