## A template dictionary whose keys represent analytical checks performed on
# a melody. Your analysis will copy this dictionary into its self.results
# attribute and then run its rules to update the value of each check in the
# dictionary. When a rule is run and it determines a check is successful, the
# rule will set the dictionary value (e.g. self.analysis['MEl_START_NOTE'])
# to True and if its not successful it will set it to a list of zero or more
# values as described below.
melodic_checks = {
    
    # Pitch checks

    ## Starting note must be tonic, mediant, or dominant. If the melody
    # starts correctly set this value to True, otherwise set it to an empty
    # list [].
    'MEL_START_NOTE': None,

    ## Last two notes must be melodic cadence (2-1 or 7-1). If the
    # melody ends correctly set this value to True, otherwise set
    # it to an empty list [].
    'MEL_CADENCE': None,

    ## At least 75% of notes must be within the tessitura (central Major
    # 6th of the melody's range). If the check is successful set this value
    # to true, otherwise set it to an empty list [].
    'MEL_TESSITURA': None,

    ## All pitches must be diatonic. If the check is successful set
    # this value to True, otherwise set it to a list containing the
    # note positions of each note that fails. Note positions start
    # on 1 not 0.
    'MEL_DIATONIC': None,

    # Melodic interval checks

    ## At least 51% of notes must be stepwise.  If the check is successful
    # set this value to True, otherwise set it to an empty list [].
    'INT_STEPWISE': None,

    ## All intervals must be consonant (P4 is consonant). If the check
    # is successful set this value to True, otherwise set it to a list
    # containing the note positions of each note that fails. Note
    # positions start on 1 not 0. Since this check involves an interval
    # between two notes, use the position of the note to the left
    # of the offending interval.
    'INT_CONSONANT': None,

    ## All intervals must be an octave or less. If the check is successful
    # set this value to True, otherwise set it to a list containing the
    # note positions of each note that fails. Note positions start on 1
    # not 0. Since this check involves an interval between two notes, use
    # the position of the note to the left of the offending interval.
    'INT_SIMPLE': None,

    ## Max number of large leaps is 1. A large leap is defined as a perfect
    # fifth or more. If the check is successful set this value to True,
    # otherwise set it to a list containing the note positions of each
    # interval after the first one.
    'INT_NUM_LARGE': None,

    ## Max number of unisons is 1. If the check is successful set this
    # value to True, otherwise set it to a list containing the note
    # positions of each unison after the first one.
    'INT_NUM_UNISON': None,

    ## Max number of consecutive intervals moving in same direction is 3
    # (i.e four consecutive notes). If the check is successful set this
    # value to True, otherwise set it to a list containing the note
    # positions of each interval after the third one.
    'INT_NUM_SAMEDIR': None,

    # Leap checks

    ## Leap of 4th must reverse direction, leap of 5th or more must reverse
    # by step. The leap can be the result of a single interval or by multiple
    # consecutive leaps in the same direction. For multiple leaps in the same
    # direction, the total size of the leap should be the sum of all the leaps
    # in the same direction. If the check is successful set this value to True,
    # otherwise set it to a list containing the note positions of each interval
    # that fails. To mark a leap spanning a 5th or greater that did not reverse
    # by step, set its note index to be negative.
    'LEAP_RECOVERY': None,

    ## Max number of consecutive leaps in a row is 2 (three notes). If the
    # check is successful set this value to True, otherwise set it to a list
    # containing the note positions of each interval after the second leap.
    'LEAP_NUM_CONSEC': None,

    # Shape checks

    ## Max number of climax notes is 1.  If the check is successful set
    # this value to True, otherwise set it to a list containing the note
    # positions of each climax after the first.
    'SHAPE_NUM_CLIMAX': None,

    ## Climax note must be located within the center third of melody.  If
    # the check is successful set this value to True, otherwise set it to a
    # list containing the note positions of all climaxes outside it.
    'SHAPE_ARCHLIKE': None,

    ## A set of intervals with at least one direct repetition cannot
    # occupy more than 50% of melody. If the check is successful set this
    # value to True, otherwise set it to a list containing the set of
    # interval motions (e.g [2, 2, -3].
    'SHAPE_UNIQUE': None

# * self.results: A dictionary containing the set of analytical checks your
# analysis performs. Your rules will update specific checks in this dictionary.
